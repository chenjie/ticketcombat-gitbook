Hi Chenjie,

Thank you for your comments on my website.  While I appreciate your offer to translate and publish the site in Mandarin, there are a couple of problems.

First, while the site does not make a lot of money, I rely on the advertising on the site to pay for the cost of hosting it.  If web traffic is redirected to github, it will destroy the way I keep the site going.

Second, I'm doing a major re-write of this site.  The law is constantly changing and a static translation will get out of date very quickly, misleading readers.

While not perfect, a web based translation service like Google translate can translate a web page so that the original site can be updated and users can translate on the fly.  It is not ideal but it does allow for updates and current information.

I know that the site could be more user friendly, especially for mobile, and I'm hoping to address this in the next re-write and a new design.

I know your offer comes with the best intentions, and I truly appreciate that.  I think, for the reasons above, that it would be better to not publish in a public repository.

Sincerely,
xxx
